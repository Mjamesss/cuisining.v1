            A swivel peeler is a versatile kitchen tool designed for peeling a variety of fruits and vegetables. It features a pivoting blade that adjusts to the contours of the food, allowing for smooth and efficient peeling. This flexibility helps reduce waste by removing only the skin while preserving the flesh underneath.
