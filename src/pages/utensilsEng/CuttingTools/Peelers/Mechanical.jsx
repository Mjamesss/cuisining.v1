            A mechanical peeler is an advanced kitchen tool designed for hands-free peeling. It typically features a rotating mechanism that automatically removes the skin from fruits and vegetables, making it ideal for bulk food preparation. This peeler is commonly used for apples, potatoes, and other round produce.

Some mechanical peelers also include additional features, such as slicing or coring functions, making them versatile tools for professional and home kitchens. With minimal effort, they provide consistent and uniform peeling, reducing preparation time for large cooking tasks.
