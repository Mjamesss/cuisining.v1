            Swiss, speed, and Y-peelers have a distinctive Y-shaped design that provides a firm and balanced grip. The horizontal blade sits between two arms, allowing for quick and effortless peeling. These peelers are commonly used for peeling both hard and soft-skinned produce, including potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, and tomatoes.

The sharp blade ensures smooth peeling with minimal effort, making food preparation faster and more efficient. Some models also feature a pointed tip for removing blemishes or eyes from potatoes. The compact and lightweight design makes them easy to handle and store, making them a popular choice in professional and home kitchens.
