            A Santoku knife is a Japanese-style knife known for its precision and 
            versatility in the kitchen. It has a shorter, wider blade with a slight curve,
            making it ideal for slicing, dicing, and mincing. The word "Santoku"
            translates to "three virtues," referring to its ability to handle meat, fish,
            and vegetables with ease.

            Unlike a chefâ€™s knife, the Santoku knife has a thinner blade and a granton
            edge, which helps prevent food from sticking. Its lightweight design 
            makes it easy to control, making it a great choice for those who prefer a 
            more balanced and comfortable grip while preparing ingredients.
