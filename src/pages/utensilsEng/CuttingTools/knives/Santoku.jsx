            A Santoku knife is a Japanese-style knife known for its precision and <br></br>
            versatility in the kitchen. It has a shorter, wider blade with a slight curve,<br></br> 
            making it ideal for slicing, dicing, and mincing. The word "Santoku"<br></br>
            translates to "three virtues," referring to its ability to handle meat, fish,<br></br>
            and vegetables with ease.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Unlike a chefâ€™s knife, the Santoku knife has a thinner blade and a granton<br></br>
            edge, which helps prevent food from sticking. Its lightweight design <br></br>
            makes it easy to control, making it a great choice for those who prefer a <br></br>
            more balanced and comfortable grip while preparing ingredients.
