These are one-sided paddle-style graters. While they only bring one size option to the table (unlike the four-sided box grater), they’re ideal for grating right into the bowl. They typically have large, very sharp holes, with a rubber-lined base to prevent slipping. They’re also thinner to store. Grate slowly as you get closer to the holes, they can cut fingers easily!
